In Qubit you will start at level 1 and as you sucessfully complete each level you will move to the next one. We have three phases: foundation, intermediate and advanced.

# Foundation

In the foundation phase, you will learn about fundmental programming concepts using 4 different programming langauges: Python, CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

## Level 1 (Introduction to Programming)
In this level you will learn your first programming langauge and that would be Python. This level is 4 weeks long. It consist of 4 session per week and each session is 2 hours long. The course will be give to you by a class instructor and attendence is mendeatory.
Half-hour will be for theory and explination and 1 hour and 30 minutes in each session the students will spent it solving practical questions related to the session learning objectives. 

 ## Level 2 (Independent programing)
Level 3 is an independent programming course. This course will retouch the programing concept you studied in level1 using Python programing langauge and introduce two new programing langauges that is HTML and CSS. The course is two weeks long, 6 days per week and 3 hours per day. The students have the freedum to perform these session in the time most sutabile for them. However, they have to come to the institution to enable the instrustor to track their performance on the course.

## Level 3 (Intorduction to Database, Algorithm and Advance programming concept)
In this level students will learn about the differnet availabe types of database and they will be introduced to important algorithms that are frequently used such as: quick sort, shortest path...etc. Futhermore, using **Java Script** students will be introduced to advance programing concept such as: Reactive programming, Design pattern and Software architecture patterns.
 
 
# Intermediate 
 
 In the intermediate phase, students will start to use langauage Framworks and Tools that help create real world software applications.
 
## Level 4 (CS Tools)
There are a number of tools that are widely used to make programming process easier, faster and more efficient. 
Topics covered in this level include: terminals and shell scripting, vim, command line environments, version control and more.
 
 ## Level 5 (software development)
In this level students will be put into group. Each group will be developing a differnt complete web application. The application will be developed using the MERN Stack. MERN is the acronym for MongoDB, Express JS, React JS and Node JS. 

Students during this level they will be introduced to:

* The **Scrum framwork**
* Issue tracking tools like _Github Issue_ and _Jira_.
* Requesting help and support using _Stack Overflow_ and _Github Issue_.
* Team managment and communication tools such as _Gitter_, _Slack_ and _ClickUp_.
* Other platforms such as _LinkedIn_, _Google Drive_,_Canva_

 # Advanced
 In this phase, each student has to specialize in one of the following software development roles:

1. Full-Stack Web Developer
2. Mobile Developer
3. Data Analyst
4. DevOps Engineer/ Infrastructure Developer
5. AI and Machine learning Specialist
6. Game Developer
7. Blockchain Developer
8. Computer Security Engineer
9. Quality Assurance Engineer
