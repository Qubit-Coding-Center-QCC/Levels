In Qubit you will start at level 1 and as you successfully complete each level you will move to the next one. We have three phases: foundation, intermediate and advanced. Many of the course materials are adapted from [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum), written by Erik Trautman and [The OSSU curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#introduction-to-programming)

# Foundation

In the foundation phase, you will learn about fundamental programming concepts using 4 different programming languages: Python, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

## Level 1 (Introduction to Programming)
At this level, you will learn your first programming language and that would be Python. This level is 4 weeks long. It consists of 4 sessions per week and each session is 2 hours long. The course will be given to you by a class instructor and attendance is mandatory.
Half-hour will be for theory and explanation and 1 hour and 30 minutes in each session the students will spend it solving practical questions related to the session learning objectives. 

 ## Level 2 (Independent Programming)
Level 3 is an independent programming course. This course will retouch the programing concept you studied in level1 using the Python programming language and introduce two new programming languages that are HTML and CSS. The course is two weeks long, 6 days per week and 3 hours per day. The students have the freedom to perform these sessions in the time most suitable for them. However, they have to come to the institution to enable the instructor to track their performance on the course.

## Level 3 (Advanced Topics in Computer programming)
At this level, students will learn about the different available types of databases and they will be introduced to important algorithms that are frequently used such as quicksort, shortest path...etc. Furthermore, using **Java Script** students will be introduced to advance programming concepts such as Reactive programming, Design pattern, and Software architecture patterns.
 
 
# Intermediate 
 
 In the intermediate phase, students will start to use language Framework and Tools that help create real-world software applications.
 
## Level 4 (CS Tools)
There are a number of tools that are widely used to make the programming process easier, faster, and more efficient. 
Topics covered in this level include terminals and shell scripting, vim, command-line environments, version control, and more.
 
 ## Level 5 (Software Development)
At this level, students will be put into groups. Each group will be developing a different complete web application. The application will be developed using the MERN Stack. MERN is the acronym for MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, and Node JS. 

Students during this level will be introduced to:

* The **Scrum framework**
* Issue tracking tools like _Github Issue_ and _Jira_.
* Requesting help and support using _Stack Overflow_ and _Github Issue_.
* Team management and communication tools such as _Gitter_, _Slack_ and _ClickUp_.
* Other platforms such as _LinkedIn_, _Google Drive_,_Canva_

 # Advanced
 
 ## Level 6
 In this phase, each student has to specialize in one of the following software development roles:

- [x] Full-Stack Web Developer
- [x] Mobile Developer
- [x] AI and Machine learning Specialist
- [x] DevOps Engineer/ Infrastructure Developer
- [ ] Data Analyst (to be supported in 2022)
- [ ] Game Developer (to be supported in 2022)
- [ ] Blockchain Developer (to be supported in 2022)
- [ ] Computer Security Engineer (to be supported in 2022)
- [ ] Quality Assurance Engineer (to be supported in 2022)
